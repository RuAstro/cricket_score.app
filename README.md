# What the cricket scorer app is about.
- Cricket scoring app, to track score of the game.
- Makes scoring for coaches a lot easier and faster, so that there is not a moment to miss on the field. Everything by just a click of buttons.
- The feature of app will be updated regally.
- The idea of the app is to spare some time and have bit more outlook on whats happening on the field. And does not feel rush for next tracking ball that follows.
- User can log in with same username and password, when register.

# Cricket_app explanation.
- Program should take teams name.
- Have buttons for runs(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with the two batsmen facing the balls on the pitch.
- Will also show strike rate from each batsmen through out the season.
- Buttons for extra runs, for example(wide, no ball, leg byes etc.)
- Will have a total of runs scoring as the game goes on and runs added to the total.
- Have edit space for bowlers that are bowling currently to put in their names and balls they are bowling with the total runs that are being hit by their name.(for each bowler their will be tracking average number of balls bowled per wicked taken)
- Will automatically work out the RR(run rate) and CRR(current run rate for batsmen)
- Can also make a log for the season for each league that are participating in the season for each team.
- Will automatically declare winner after all batsmen are out, or when all runs are chased.

# Formula for, RR, RRR, SR and SR Bowling.
- *RR* = **number of runs / numbers of overs bowled**
- *RRR* = **number of runs required of batting team(to win the match) / by total numbers of overs remaining in the match**
- *SR* = **/ total number of runs they scored by number of deliveries they have faced x(multiply) by 100**
- *SR Bowling* = **number of balls bawled / number of wickets taken with these balls**

# Technical Requirements
- *Build in Python*
- *Using flask*
